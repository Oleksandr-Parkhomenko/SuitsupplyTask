# Some ideas about improvements:

I think that example of the Coat and Shirt takes a lot of space (about 2/3 of the page). At the same time, Suit and Trousers (about 1/3 of the page). It is better to have the same page design everywhere. It will also give Fabrick, Style, and others components more space on the page. 

The performance also should be improved. It takes a lot of time to load Fabric, Summary, and Checkout pages (sometimes about 5-7 seconds to display content).

I assume there is some issue on the website in the transition from 'Choose your text color' to 'Choose your text style'. Very often, stuck on half of the way. I see half of the 'Choose your text color' and 'Choose your text style' simultaneously. 

It is better to use the same font size in the left side menu. For example, 'Design Your Own' and 'Coat' have different sizes.

I noticed that some Fabric type could be unavailable to select. It is present one day, but the next day it is absent. I think it will be better to display all types of Fabric but make it not selectable if it is out of stock or unavailable for other reasons.
