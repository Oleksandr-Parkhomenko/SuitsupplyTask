# In the following test script of a Custom Made Coats configurator, I would add:

Selection of the Fabric using 'Filter' and/or 'Search' options.
Chose the 'Extended Length'.
Use the search option in the lining selection.
Use the search option in the selection of the button option.
Add first and second Initials (Currently, I did not implement it because of the transition from 'Choose your text color' to 'Choose your text style' very often stuck on half of the way. I see half of the 'Choose your text color' and 'Choose your text style' simultaneously. I assume there is some issue on the website in this transition). 
Add a check for the 'Prev' button.
In a separate test script, I would check the navigation through the 'Fabric', 'Style', 'Size', and 'Summary' stepper after filling in obligatory fields. To verify if it is possible to navigate through them randomly.
Also, 'Need size help', 'Add another email', 'Save & Share', all 'Cross' buttons should be covered with the tests.
In a separate test script, I would check the checkout using 'Returning customer' and 'New Customer' (By the way, 'Returning customer' and 'New Customer' - the word customer written differently (Capital letter)). Also, Login via Google and Apple should be tested, and the 'Forgot password option.
Also could be added some low prior checks like 'Fabric' details ("i" button), top search, 'Bag' (if it is possible to remove item), 'View bag' and 'PayPal' buttons, if it is possible to zoom in and out the Coat and implemented multiple negative tests scripts to check how website handle those.
