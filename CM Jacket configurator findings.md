# Findings:

- The multiple results are displayed when selecting a unique Fabric name ('Light Grey Pure Linen'). The two results are displayed with a different images. There shouldn't be the same names with various images of the Fabric.

- There is no informational message if some of the obligatory settings weren't selected or entered (Ex.: Initials in the Personalize module).

- The 'Need size help?' button overlapping with other elements on the page when making screen size smaller.

- Hints are missing in multiple places. Sometimes it is not obvious what will happen when clicking on some button (Ex.: "Save & Share  Register below to receive your configuration by email.").

- When entering an invalid email and adding more one email, the 'Unfortunately, that is not a valid email' message overlapping with the 'Check' sign on the 'Need size help?' modal.

- Performance improvement needed - After clicking the "ADD TO BAG" button, it takes a lot of time to load the checkout page.

- The Intercom icon is overlapping with the 'Email' link on the 'Checkout-Login' page.
